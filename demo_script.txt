Hi, my name is Hiruna Randika Perera, and this is my ICT171 Assignment 2 submission.

This project demonstrates the setup of an OpenVPN server on an AWS EC2 instance. I chose this project because VPNs are a key part of secure remote access, and provides secure and encrypted access to the internet.

I launched an EC2 instance, connected via SSH, and installed OpenVPN using a trusted script. I then generated a client config file, downloaded it using SCP, and tested it on my Windows machine using OpenVPN GUI.

The connection was successful, and the project files are uploaded to GitHub including the script and documentation. Thank you.
